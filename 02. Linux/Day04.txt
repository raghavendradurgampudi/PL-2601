ALIAS
alias w="whoami"

Setting the hostname for a server
    4  hostname

    6  hostnamectl set-hostname linux-server
    7  sudo hostnamectl set-hostname linux-server
    8  sudo -i

Creation of directories in Linux
Directory is nothing but a folder
mkdir kastro
mkdir dir1 dir2 dir3 dir4
ls
mkdir -v Linux
mkdir -v linux1 linx2
mkdir "kastro kiran"
cd dir1
cd ..
cd ../..

Absolute Path	- it means we should the complete path in a single command
Relative Path		- it mean we need to go inside one specific directory

cd -
cd ~

ls dir1

sudo yum install tree -y
tree
tree dir1

Nested or Child directories
mkdir -p dir5/dir5.1/dir5.2/dir5.3/dir5.4

ls -l
ls -lr
ll

If the starting character is "d" then it is a directory
ls -ltr
ls -lt

ls dir5
ll dir5
ls -l dir5

To see hidden files and directories
ls -a
ls -al

rmdir <dir-name> ---> to delete empty directory
rm -rf dir5 ---> it will delete all the child directories and the parent directory

rm -rf * ---> to delete everything available in the current location

Creation of files in Linux
1. touch
2. cat
3. vi (or) vim
4. nano
5. echo

touch kastro.txt
touch kiran.txt kk.txt linux.txt day3.txt

touch linux{1..10}.py

If the starting character is "-" then it is a file

rm kiran.txt
rm kastro.txt kk.txt linux.txt

rm *.py
rm kastro*

cat > kiran.txt
cat kiran.txt
tac linux.py

cat >> kastro.txt

cat -n kastro.txt

vi is an file editor in Linux 
: wq ---> save and quit from the file
:q! ---> force quit (without saving)

^ (control)

nano linux.py

echo "we are working with file creation" > kiran.txt
echo "we are working with file creation" >> kiran.txt

cat *.txt

MORE and LESS commands
more *.txt

less *.txt
:n ---> next file content 
:p ---> previous file content
q ---> quit from the file
