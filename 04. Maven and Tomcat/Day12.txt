Module 3: Maven & Tomcat | Day 12 | 20-01-2025
============================================================================================================
Manual Deployment of Application in Tomcat
==================================
Install Java
Install and Setup Tomcat

Edit the 'context.xml' file as below in manager and host-manager directories ---->
<Context antiResourceLocking="false" privileged="true">
  <Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteAddrValve"
         allow="^.*$" />
</Context>

Edit the 'tomcat-users.xml' file as below ---->
  <role rolename="manager-gui"/>
  <role rolename="admin-gui"/>
  <user username="tomcat" password="tomcat" roles="manager-gui"/>
  <user username="admin" password="admin" roles="manager-gui,admin-gui"/>

Repo URL: https://github.com/KastroVKiran/tomcat-app-kastro.git

Version 1 ----> LIVE
Version 2 ----> Update the app ----> Compile & Package (Manual processs) ----> Deploy to Tomcat (Manual process)

To automate the application deployment (Packaging and Deployment), we need to use CI & CD tools
	CI & CD Tools - Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab, AWS Code Pipeline, Azure DevOps (Azure Pipelines)....



Module 4: Jenkins, Nexus & SonarQube | Day 12 | 20-01-2025
============================================================================================================
CI & CD - It is the process of automating the build and deployment of applications

CI - Continuous Integration
		Developer ----> Write the code (V1) ----> Test the code (V1) ----> Approval ----> Build the code ----> GitHub Repo
		Developer ----> Update the code (V2) ----> Test the code (V2) ----> Approval ----> Build the code ----> GitHub Repo
		Developer ----> Update the code (V3) ----> Test the code (V3) ----> Approval ----> Build the code ----> GitHub Repo
CI is combination of Continuous Testing (CT) and Continuous Building (CB)

CD - Continuous Delivery
	If you are manually deploying the application into the server that process is known as Continuous Delivery

CD - Continuous Deployment
	The process of automating the application deployment is known as Continuous Deployment

To automate the application deployment process, we will use CI&CD tools

CD & CD Tools: Jenkins, GitHub Action, GitLab, AWS Code Pipeline, Azure Pipelines....

Stages available in the CI & CD process;
Git Checkout			- get the code from GitHub repo
Build the code			- generate the artifacts (using build tools such as maven)
Store the artifact			- for roll back purposes we need to store the artifact (Nexus, JFrog, S3 Bucket...)
Security scanning		- SonarQube is used to perform the code quality analysis
Deep level scanning		- Trivy, Owasp, Docker scout image analysis... (Image Scanning)
Deploy the artifact		- Tomcat/Docker/Kubernetes Cluster

JENKINS
Jenkins is a CI & CD tool that automates the build and deployment of application
Jenkins is developed by using Java
If you want to work with Jenkins, we need to install Java (17/21/24)
Jenkins will run on port number 8080
2011 - Hudson Project (Not free)
Sun Micro Systems acquired Hudson Project and they renamed to Jenkins (Free and Open Source)

Installation of Jenkins
------------------------------------------
https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/linux/

sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo \
    https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key
sudo yum upgrade
# Add required dependencies for the jenkins package
    sudo dnf install java-17-amazon-corretto -y
sudo yum install jenkins
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable jenkins
sudo systemctl start jenkins
sudo systemctl status jenkins


Jenkins Jobs
A job is nothing but a task
Using Jenkins we will create Jobs (Jenkins Jobs)

Types of Jenkins jobs;
1. Freestyle Project			- if you configure the job information using the UI of Jenkins, such kind of jobs are known as freestyle projects
2. Pipeline					- if you configure the job information using script, such kind of jobs are known as Pipelines
3. Multi-branch Pipeline		- if you configure the job information using script, such kind of jobs are known as Pipelines

Understanding Freestyle Projects;
In freestyle projects we have 6 configuration options;
General					- name and description for the job
SCM					- we will configure out repo url
Triggers					- we will define how the job has to be built
Environment			- we will specify environment variables for the job
Build Steps				- we will specify how to build the code
Post Build Actions		- we will specify where to do the deployment

All the job information will be stored in the Jenkins home directory  ----> /var/lib/jenkins

Create a Shell File (/tmp)
write the commands to install nginx/httpd (or apache2) (All commands must start with sudo)
Run the job

Throttle Build;
If i want to restrict the number of builds to happen in a specific time, we will use Throttle Build

60 - 5

Upstream and Downstream Jobs (Build after other projects are built);
Job1	- manually build	- success
Job2	- automatically triggered - success
Job3	- automatically triggered

microservices app;
Job 1 - movies
Job 2 - sports
Job 3 - documentaries

Note: All the jobs must be built atleast
