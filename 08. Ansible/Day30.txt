Module 7: Ansible | Day 30 | 19-02-2026
============================================================================================================

Ansible Installation on Master Node
sudo dnf install python3-pip -y
pip install ansible
ansible --version

Setting up the host inventory file
Note: By default, in the latest versions we will not have host inventory file in /etc/ansible/hosts path. We need to explicitly create this path and also the inventory file

Step 1 — Create /etc/ansible/ directory
sudo mkdir -p /etc/ansible

Step 2 — Create a config file
sudo nano /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg

Paste this minimal configuration:
[defaults]
inventory=/etc/ansible/hosts
host_key_checking=False

Save & exit.

Step 3 — Create the hosts inventory file
sudo nano /etc/ansible/hosts

Add your hosts:
[dev-servers]
your-ec2-private-ip-here

[test-servers]
your-ec2-private-ip-here

Save & exit.

=> Ansible Roles
In Ansible Roles, we will write separate playbooks for each module and then we can call whichever playbook we want to execute
Ansible roles are used o divide the playbook in to a directory structure

Module 8: Terraform | Day 30 | 19-02-2026
============================================================================================================
Terraform is used to automate the infrastructure creation
IaaC Tools: Terraform, Pulimi, Open Tofu

Cloud Specific Services:
	AWS - Cloud Formation
	Google - Deployment Provider
	Azure - Azure Resource Manager

Terraform was launched in the year 2014
Invented by Mitchel Hashimoto
Developer by Hashicorp Company
Developer by using Go Programming Language
HCL - Hashicorp Configuration Language
Terraform is free and open source software

All the terraform files will have an extension as ".tf"

terraform.io

In the directory structure of terraform, we have some important files
provider.tf		- we will configure provider info - in which cloud and in which region
main.tf			- contains the core info about the resource creation
variables.tf		- define the variables
terraform.tfvars	- define the values for the variables
outputs.tf		- output info

backend.tf

Terraform Commands;
terraform init		-to initialize terraform - it will download all the provider plugins
terraform validate	- to validate the syntax of the .tf files
terraform fmt		- to arrange the terraform code in a decent structure 
terraform plan		- it will show the resource info (it wont actually create the resource)
terraform apply		- to create the actual resources
terraform destroy		- to delete the resource

Terraform installation
sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo https://rpm.releases.hashicorp.com/AmazonLinux/hashicorp.repo
sudo dnf -y install terraform
terraform --version

Core structure of terraform files;
blocks
labels
arguments

provider block
resource block
output block

any block with start with { and will end with }
for each block we will have block label

{
inside the block, we will write arguments - key-value pairs
}

identifier ----> _
if you want to combine two words, we will combine using _
instance type	 ----> instance_type

When we initialize terraform, the terraform.lock.hcl file will get created.
This file consists provider version info

Statefile gets created usually after executing terraform plan / terraform apply (terraform.tfstate)
